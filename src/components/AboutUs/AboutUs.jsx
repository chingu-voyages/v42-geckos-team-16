          <h4>Our Story</h4>
          <p>
            We're a family-owned business based out of Toronto that works
            closely with the Harney family to offer Harney & Sons Fine Teas in
            Canada. We wholesale and retail a large selection of teas in a
            variety of packing options including in bulk and in beautifully
            designed tins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before establishing Premium Teas, the co-founder was working for
            world-renowned companies in the hospitality industry including the
            Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago in 2005, learning first-hand about
            afternoon tea service and Harney & Sons. After that, with a decade
            of experience in the hot beverage industry, he decided to start his
            own venture together with his wife, who has been working to ensure
            that you have great online shopping experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of our efforts, we're proud to share that we have served
            thousands of happy customers since 2015 and will continue to work
            hard and ensure that you're having a real good cuppa in your hands.
            Cheers!

          <h4>OUR MISSION</h4>
          <p>
            We're extending the Harneys' mission to "offer the finest teas in
            the world at a price that makes it an everyday luxury" by providing
            access to a large variety of Harney & Sons Fine Teas at reasonable
            prices with low-rate and free shipping options within Canada. We
            also wholesale to coffee shops and cafes, bakeries, hotels, spas,
            specialty shops and restaurants so that you can experience our
            products even when you're having a drink outside of your home. Weâ€™ve
            done the hard yards to bring Harney & Sons to Canada and we'd love
            you to taste our tea selection and share our passion for these great
            teas.
